# Black-Hat-Go-book
Coding exercises from Black Hat Go

This repository will contain all the coding examples of the Black Hat Go book and it will be updated as I progress with the book.
There won't be much differences from the code examples in the book except for my notes and some modifications on the final program 
of each chapter.
This is my attempt to learn the Go language creating tools for Cyber Security / Penetration Testing.
